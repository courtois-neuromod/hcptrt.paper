## HCP-TRT dataset

This `cneuromod` dataset is called HCP test-retest (`hcptrt`), because participants repeated 15 times the functional localizers developed by the Human Connectome Project, for a total of approximately 10 hours of functional data per subject. The protocol consisted of seven tasks, described below (text adapted from the [HCP protocol](http://protocols.humanconnectome.org/HCP/3T/task-fMRI-protocol-details.html)). Before each task, participants were given detailed instructions and examples, as well as a practice run.
